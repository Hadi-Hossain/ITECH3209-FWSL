Project Introduction:
The Foundation for Young Australians(FYA) is an Australian non-profit organisation whose purpose is to improve the learning outcomes and life opportunities of young Australians. Projects of the foundation include the Safe Schools Coalition Australia and publishing research.
The Future work skills log is a project which was designed by FYA for the Federation Tech School which will be used by junior students to track learnt skills from there time on the tech school campus. These tracked skills can be verified by the tech school and used as valid certificates in the appropriate skill.
The proposed solution will solve this problem and enhance the student experience using the skill track record which are installed in FYA database. This objective will be achieved by providing a user-friendly website and a mobile application to the students alongside with a new student email address; enabling them to notify the new skills available on the website of FYA alongside with the existing skills learning materials. 

Project Goal:
The goal of the Future work skills project is to create software which can be used by students at the tech school which allows them to track and present the skills they have acquired from their time on campus.

Vision:
Students can more understand what the skills need when they are going to work.
Students can put their own skills and can achived certificate from administrator.
Students will get feedback from the administrator before they get accredation.
Students can print it out their accredition in a PDF folder.
